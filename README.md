# FTPServer
A, not entirely correct nor practical, FTP server written in Kotlin
I made this in around 3 hours

## Features
- Support for active mode
- Support for passive mode
- Support for almost all commands issued by the Linux/Unix FTP tool
- Multiple users connected at the same time

## Why you shouldn't use this
- Encryption is disabled
- Crashing this is easy
- Authentication isn't implemented
- There are no restrictions on what folders you can mess with

## Why was this made?
This is a small project, which is mainly intended for research and documentation purposes

P.S. I know the code is trash, I don't care
